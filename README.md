# URL Shortener Microservice

This is a [freeCodeCamp project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/url-shortener-microservice) for the Back End Development and APIs certification.

Check out the [live app](url-shortener.spenalozacortes.repl.co).

## What I Learned
- How to use the .env file.
- How to connect to a MongoDB database hosted in Atlas.
- How to insert and query documents using the mongoose package.
- How to set up an auto incrementing field.
- Apparently the mongoose methods no longer accept callbacks. Although I was already familiar with the async...await syntaxis, this is the first time I actually use it in a project.
- How to use the dns core module.
- How to redirect to an external URL from one of my endpoints.
- That I should keep my node version up to date. :grimacing:
